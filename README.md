üóÇÔ∏è Project_Management_Tool

* Project_Management_Tool is a collaborative full-stack project management web application inspired by Trello.
* It enables users to create, manage, and collaborate on projects by organizing tasks into To Do, In Progress, and Completed columns. 
* Users can assign members, set deadlines, upload attachments, and comment on tasks‚Äîall within a clean drag-and-drop interface.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üí° Tech Stack Used-

Frontend:
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 Static pages for login, registration, project dashboard (`projectmanager.html`), and task board (`taskmanager.html`)
 Client-side interactivity and drag-and-drop handled in JS
 Located in the `/public` folder

Backend:
* Node.js with Express.js
 Handles API routing, authentication, sessions, and business logic
 All backend logic is modularized in the `/Project-Management-Tool/` directory

Database:
* MySQL with Sequelize (ORM)
 Stores user accounts, projects, tasks, comments, assignments, deadlines
 Database connection configured in `config/db.js`

Authentication:
* Passport.js for middleware authentication
* Google OAuth (`passport-google-oauth20`) for login
* `express-session` for managing login sessions

Environment:
* Environment variables configured in `.env.demo` and loaded via `dotenv`

üìÅ Folder & File Overview -

Top-Level Files and Folders:

 * `.env.demo`  
  Example environment file containing keys like `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `SESSION_SECRET`, and MySQL credentials (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, etc.)
 * `.gitignore`  
  Excludes sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, `node_modules`, etc.) from version control
 * `server.js`  
  Main application entry point:
  -Initializes Express server
  - Connects to MySQL using Sequelize
  - Applies middleware for parsing requests and managing sessions
  - Integrates all route modules and authentication
 * `package.json` & `package-lock.json`  
  Define Node.js project metadata and dependencies

 üöÄ How to Start the Project?
 
 Make sure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) ‚Äì Ensure the MySQL server is running locally or use a remote instance


1. Download Zip or Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/PoojithaBonela/Project_Management_Tool.git
cd Project_Management_Tool-master
```
2. Install Node.js Dependencies inside the folder
```
npm install
```
3. Environment Setup :
* This project includes a `.env.demo` file with **real Google OAuth credentials** pre-filled which can be used directly for testing purposes only.
* The database values in `.env.demo` are placeholders.
* Replace these placeholders with your actual DB credentials.
```
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=your-db-name
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
```
* If you want to use your own MongoDB and Google OAuth credentials Update `.env.demo`:
```
MONGO_URI=your_own_mongodb_connection_string
SESSION_SECRET=any_random_secure_string
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
```
4. Run the Server:
```
node server.js
```
or
```
npm start
```

5. Open the App:
Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
